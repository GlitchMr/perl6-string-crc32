Perl6 String::CRC32
===================

http://github.com/cosimo/perl6-string-crc32/

Pure Perl6 version of String::CRC32 from Perl5.
Based on CPAN version 1.4 by SÃ¶nke J. Peters.

Current status (2010/08/02)
===========================

Needed for Cache::Memcached.
Works fine, maybe slower than the Perl5 XS :)
